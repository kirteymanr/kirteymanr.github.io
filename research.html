    <h3 class="resume_accent">Title: Design and development of elastic scattering spectroscopy (ESS)-based probe for breast cancer diagnosis and margin detection. </h3>
    <p> Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the female population worldwide. The death rate can
        be reduced with efficient diagnostic techniques at the early stage. This research showcased a novel, robust, and cost-
        effective elastic scattering spectroscopy (ESS)-based probe that can aid surgeons in effectively diagnosing breast cancer
        during surgery. The experiments were performed on formalin-fixed malignant and adjacent normal breast tissues obtained
        from N=18 patients. The ESS-Dx probe utilizes four different laser diodes for illumination with operating wavelengths of
        850 nm, 980 nm, 1270 nm, and 1550 nm.</p>
        <p></p>The proposed ESS-based probe system is able to distinguish the cancerous tissue (C) and adjacent normal tissue (N) based on their optical properties (Reflectance, Absorption coefficient, and  Scattering coefficient ).  </p>

    <h3 class="resume_accent">Project 1: Three Axis Gimbal.</h3>
    <p><strong>Course:</strong> Mechatronics System Design </p>
    <p><strong>Course Instructor:</strong> Professor L Umanand</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Designed a self-stabilizing platform that keeps its payload at a level despite external movement. This is achieved by stacking three perpendicular rotational axes attached to servo motors.</li>
        <li>The gyroscope monitors the platform's tilt continuously. The microcontroller then uses this information to generate PWM signal for each servo motor.</li>
        <li>These servo motors rotate the arms in opposite directions of the movement, nullifying the overall effect.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Course:</strong> Design for the Internet of Things </p>
    <p><strong>Course Instructor:</strong> Professor T.V. Prabhakar</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed a smart mat employing a grid of pressure sensors for intruder detection. This system is further enhanced with a geophone sensor that identifies intruders based on floor vibrations caused by footsteps.</li>
        <li>Both sensors wirelessly transmit alerts in real-time to the owner via the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. It supports bi-directional messaging and ensures reliable message delivery through Quality of service (QoS) measures.</li>

    <p><strong>Course:</strong> Hardware Acceleration and Optimization for Machine Learning </p>
    <p><strong>Course Instructor:</strong> Professor Chetan Singh Thakur</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed an animal and bird call detection system using a neural network. Short audio segments (3.5 seconds) were extracted from continuous-time data to calculate mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) representing spectral characteristics of the audio segments.</li>
        <li>A 1D Convolutional Neural Network with eight filters and a kernel size of three extracts patterns from the MFCCs. These patterns are then fed to a fully connected layer that classifies the audio signal to a specific animal or bird species.</li>

    <p><strong>Course:</strong> Efficient and secure digital circuits and systems </p>
    <p><strong>Course Instructor:</strong> Professor Utsav Banerjee</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Designed an 8-bit carry look-ahead adder circuit in CMOS logic using 45 nm process technology in LTspice. The design had a worst-case power of 22.675 microwatts and a worst-case delay of 119.8 picoseconds, suitable for low-power implementations.</li>

    <p><strong>Course Instructor:</strong> Professor Arup Polley</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Built a water level indicator system to estimate the water level in the tanks. The central controller then uses this information to regulate the pumps accordingly.</li>
        <li>Each node communicates wirelessly with the central controller using the multi-receiver capacity of the 2.4 GHz Transceiver (nRF24L01) module.</li>

    <h3 class="resume_accent">Project 1: Estimating body weight of a lying patient for adjustment of Intravenous (IV) contrast dosage during CT scans.</h3>
    <p><strong>Collaborator:</strong> GE Healthcare, Bangalore</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An Optimum Dosage of IV contrast is necessary to improve the accuracy of the examination while preventing overdose.</li>
        <li>The developed system uses an RGB-Depth camera to generate a 3D Point cloud of the patient lying on the bed.</li>
        <li>The data is preprocessed to acquire the patient's point cloud after removal of background data.</li>
        <li>The anthropometric feature values are then extracted from the patient point cloud and given to an ANN model as input values, predicting the patient's body weight.</li>
        <li>Achieved an accuracy of 73% in body weight prediction.</li>
